## A Word On Go's Type System

Go has a interesting, modern take on types that forgoes class-based inheritance paradigms in favor of _structs_ that allow you to describe the shape of objects and can also serve as contains for methods. The syntax and way of using types in Go is unlike any other language, and taking a few minutes to think about it can be a mind-opening experience for one who enjoys programming in any language.
